                <p>
                    ArcanaUnbound is a short little text-based adventure game developed in Python using PyCharm. In this 
                    game, players navigate a mysterious realm, make impactful choices, and confront an ominous overlord. 
                    The game incorporates randomized elements, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique experience. 
                    With character creation, different dialogue options, and multiple paths, the game delivers dynamic gameplay 
                    and replayability. I employed class and object-oriented programming principles to structure the game’s 
                    logic and ensure scalability for future features and expansions. I honestly made this game out of sheer boredom, it's silly.

                <h4>3D Multiplayer Loot n' Shoot Game for INIT Build Spring 2024</h4>
                <p>
                    Alliance Battlegrounds is a 3D multiplayer loot n' shoot game developed for the Spring 2024 INIT Build event. 
                    As part of a team, I contributed to the development of the game's power-up features, adding strategic elements 
                    to enhance gameplay. Additionally, I was involved in the design process, working to create visually engaging 
                    mechanics and environments. The game was developed using Unity and C#, with an emphasis on smooth multiplayer 
                    functionality and immersive player experiences in fast-paced combat scenarios.
